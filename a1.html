<p class="m8">In an enviable location at the heart of Southeast Asia and on major shipping lanes of the global economy, Singapore is a huge draw for shoppers, business people, and foodies, and provides a true bridge between East and West. Once a haven for pirates, Singapore – the Lion City – became a first-world country in just one generation. One of the Asian 'Tiger Economies' of the 1980s and '90s (along with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan), Singapore is a regional centre for technological development, finance, and international trade.
